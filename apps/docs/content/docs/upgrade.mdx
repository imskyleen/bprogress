import { Callout } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/callout';

In addition to [migrating to BProgress](/docs/migration), if you are migrating from version `1.0` of NProgress-V2, you may need to make some changes.

With version `1.1` there are a few new features and small changes.

The only change will be in the CSS. If you have a custom css, replace the id selector `#` with a class selector `.` for `nprogress`, which has now become `bprogress`.

This will give you something like this:

```diff title=CSS
- #nprogress
+ .bprogress
```

## What's new

The big news is the ability to use **multiple progress bars anywhere in your code**.

To do this you need to set a `template` to `null`:

```js
BProgress.configure({
  template: null,
});
```

And add one or more templates like this to your code:

```html
<div class="bprogress" style="display: none">
  <div class="bar">
    <div class="peg"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="spinner">
    <div class="spinner-icon"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="indeterminate">
    <div class="inc"></div>
    <div class="dec"></div>
  </div>
</div>
```

<Callout type="warn" title="Pay Attention">Don't forget to set the div with the nprogress class to `display:none` by default.</Callout>

Another new feature is the addition of the `width` value for `positionUsing`. This allows for greater flexibility, including the ability to create progress bars positioned absolutely within elements that are not directly aligned with the edges of the screen.

```js
BProgress.configure({
  positionUsing: 'width',
});
```

<Callout title="Note">
  By default, `positionUsing` will give priority to `translate3d` (depending on browser compatibility), as this method leverages GPU acceleration, providing smoother animations and better performance, especially for complex or frequently updated UI elements. Using `translate3d` helps reduce layout recalculations and enhances rendering efficiency compared to other positioning methods.
